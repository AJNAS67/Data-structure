in this repository i mainly foccused on linked list
linked list is the leanear data structure ,it contain series of connected node.
Each node consist of data value and pointer , that pointer point to the next node.


file 'linked_list' used singly list
** prepend ,in prepend methord used to add element to bigning of linked list
** append ,in append methord used to add elements to end of linked list
** inset, inset methord used to insert value in specified location 
** reverse ,reverse methord used to reverse the array
** removeIndex, removeIndex used  to remove that index element from linked list
** removeValue, removeValue used to remove that value from linked listt
** search, search methord used to search if element is present or not ,if present it return the index //in linked list didit have index,here return the value present which place
** Print ,used to print linked list


file '1_linked list' used doubly linked list
** prepend ,in prepend methord used to add element to bigning of linked list
** append ,in append methord used to add elements to end of linked list
** printReverse, printReverse methord used to print reverse order the linked list
** removeFromFront ,removeFromFront methord used to remove element from front/first element from linked list
** removeFromBack ,removeFromBack methord used to remove last element from linked list
** inset1, inset1 methord used to insert value in specified location 


file test 
 in an array  return two number get sum is 10
 first i used ordnary methord it time complexity is O(n2)
 then in reduced to O(n)
